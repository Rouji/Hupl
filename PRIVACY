HUPL PRIVACY POLICY

The only thing going out into the interwebs is the files you explicitly upload using the app. (Duh.) 
There are no user accounts, no ads, no tracking, no anything. 
Your upload history and host list are entirely local-only. 
If you don't trust me have a look at the code, or something. 

Note: this file pretty much only exists because Google's Play Store is a fucking pain in the neck and I needed something to link to.
